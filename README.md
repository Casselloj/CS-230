#The Gaming Room - Software Design Template

This repository includes the completed software design document developed for The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutiongs (CTS). The Gaming Room required a robust design to expand their multiplayer glame, "Draw It or Lose It," across multiple operating systems. Their goal was to create a scalabale and secure cross-platform environment to provide a seamless experience for users on mobile, desktop, and web platforms. To meet these requirements, I recommended a client-server model on a Linux platform, which offers flexibility and compatibility with cloud environments. Using a NoSQL database allows for dynamic data handling, while RESTful APIs and WebSockets supported real-time interactions essential for gameplay.

Throughout this project, I focused on designing a system architecture that would align with The Gaming Room's goals for scalability, data security, and cross-platform functionality. Working through the design document was instrumental in clarifying the structure and relationships of each component, which provided a clear guide when implementing the code. If I were to revise any part of this document, I would expand on memory management, sepcifically addressing in-memory caching and garbage collection strategies to enhance performance. 

Considering the user's needs for accessibility, security, and reliability was central to the design, as these elements are essential for creating a valuable gaming experience. Understanding user needs informed many decisions, from prioritizing secure data handling to choosing flexible system components that supports a seamless, multi-platform interface. In future projects, I would father extensive user feedback early in the design process to ensure that every aspect of the system aligns with both client goals and user expectations. Techniques like modular design and iterative feedback cycles will further guide me in creating well-aligned, user centered software solutions.
